This is a sample tutorial that demostrate how a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) can be used to create proposal, vote, queue and finally execute based on the differnt parameters. To create the smart contracts we have used [openzeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts) base libraries.
